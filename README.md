InstaStalker

## Background

This project idea was inspired by Reddit user [/u/vbafm](https://www.reddit.com/user/vbafm/). His [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/ahyt7w/build_something_to_learn_just_build_something_i/) was discovered by me and I decided to try to perform his example. I have always wanted to explore web development and learn python so I thought this would be a good example.

I decided to turn this into a [GitHub Project](https://github.com/srz2/instastalker) to track my progress (since I am learning) and I do plan on sharing this when it is complete.

## InstaStalker

InstaStalker is a website which allows you to "watch" a particular person's profile. It could techincally be used for anyone's but the idea was to track your own.
